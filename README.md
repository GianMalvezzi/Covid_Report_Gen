# Covid-19 Report Generator

Covid-19 is an acute respiratory infection caused by the potentially serious, highly transmissible, globally distributed SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

The proposal of this project is to make a report generator with different graphs indicating daily cases and deaths. From bar graphs to map graphs. These reports are generated in PDF using the FPDF extension.
